<!--This project was really fun. I feel like the hardest part was getting the javascript to work and uploading it to a local repository and then uploading the site through git bash. I watched so many videos for this assignment. The main page is kind of funky right now but once I delete the embedded video and figure caption, it should go back to normal looking good. I also am going to redo the images on the main page to be a certain size because right now it looks a little to weird and I couldn't mess with the height or width of the pictures because it looked all pixelated.-->

            <p>Hello! My name is Corbin Shaw. I started taking pictures only recently, but I really enjoy taking this
              photos on all of my adventures! My journey of photography started during a memorable trip to Oregon, and
              after that I was hooked. Every time I leave the house to go hiking, I can't leave without my camera.</p>
            <p>This site was made to be a collection of all of my favorite moments that I have captured. I hope it
              showcases my growth as a photographer and as an editor. I have around 10,000 pictures that I eventually
              want to slowly upload to the website. Obviously I won't include every picture,
              but I really like the idea of having a bunch of 6 picture albums that hopefully shows the beauty that I
              saw in the moment.</p>
            <p>Thank you for visiting my photography album, and I hope you enjoyed exploring my work as much as I
              enjoyed capturing all these moments!</p>

        <h2>Mt. Rainier Sunrise</h2>
        <div class="description">
          <p>My day at Mount Rainier was filled with adventure and breathtaking scenery. I explored several beautiful
            hiking trails, each offering stunning views of the iconic mountain and its surroundings.</p>

          <p>From the serene Reflection Lake to the vibrant wildflower meadows, every moment was an opportunity to
            capture the parkâ€™s beauty through my lens. I took countless photos of the diverse landscapes, cascading
            waterfalls, and charming wildlife that I encountered along the way.</p>

          <p>The fresh mountain air and the sound of rustling leaves made the experience even more enjoyable. As the day
            came to a
            close, I felt a deep sense of gratitude for the chance to connect with nature and capture its wonders.</p>

        <h2>Mt. Rainier Paradise</h2>
        <div class="description">
          <p>Visiting the Paradise area of Mount Rainier was a highlight of my outdoor adventures. Nestled at the base
            of the
            towering peak, this region is renowned for its stunning wildflower meadows and breathtaking views.</p>
          <p>I spent the day hiking through fields of wildflowers, surrounded by the beauty of the landscape and the
            fresh
            mountain air. The trails led me through lush forests and open meadows.</p>
          <p>As I hiked, I captured the scenery with my camera, from the colorful blooms to the views of the
            glacier-covered peak. The Paradise area offered countless photo opportunities, showcasing the natural beauty
            that makes
            this spot so special.</p>
          <p>The highlight of the day was reaching one of the lookout points, where I paused to soak in the magnificent
            views and
            enjoy the views of the mountains.</p>

        <h2>North Cascades</h2>
        <div class="description">
          <p>My day in the North Cascades was an amazing experience, filled with dramatic landscapes and stunning
            natural
            beauty. This rugged region is known for its towering peaks, pristine lakes, and lush forests, making it a
            hiker's
            paradise.</p>
          <p>I explored a variety of trails that led me through dense woods and along breathtaking ridges, each turn
            offering new and
            awe-inspiring views. The crisp mountain air and the sound of rushing streams added to the atmosphere.</p>
          <p>Throughout the day, I captured the essence of the North Cascades with my camera. From the vivid colors of
            alpine
            wildflowers to the striking contrast of glacial lakes against the rugged mountains, every moment was a
            chance to
            document the beauty around me.</p>
          <p>Overall, my day in the North Cascades was a perfect blend of adventure and inspiration, leaving me with
            cherished

        <h2>Oregon</h2>
        <div class="description">
          <p>My road trip to Oregon was my favorite trip Iâ€™ve ever had. We started in Portland,
            exploring the city before heading out to the breathtaking Oregon coast. It was my first time taking photos
            on a
            trip, and this was probably the easiest place to take pictures because of the scenery is just so
            breathtaking.</p>
          <p>As we reached the beach, I was instantly captivated by the vastness of the Pacific Ocean. The waves
            crashing against the rocky
            shores was a great place that we stayed at for a day. From there, we drove down the
            coast, stopping at scenic viewpoints and taking in the rugged cliffs and sea stacks that lined the horizon.
          </p>
          <p>With each stop, I grew more excited about photographing the stunning landscapes. The natural beauty of the
            Oregon coast,
            combined with the joy of exploring new places, made this road trip unforgettable.</p>
